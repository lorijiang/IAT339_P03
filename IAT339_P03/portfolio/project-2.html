                    <p> We conducted online research to determine what kind of pain points are prevelant for older users and mobile apps. From this, we realized that older adults were at higher risk for loneliness, and immigrant populations were at even higher risk. </p>

                <h2> Challenges / Lessons Learned </h2>
                <p> One of the main challenges of this project was that our scope was initially too large as we had chosen to design for mutliple older adult diaspora communities. However, upon receiving feedback we narrowed our target user group to older Chinese immigrant adults so that the language feature in the app would be easier to implement and we could have a more specific idea of how to design the interface for this group.</p>
